Hi folks!
I wan't share with github's friends how to learn react, in a Vito way.
Who is Vito ? Vito is one of my best friend.

Vito is a smart guy and surf around web.

### 1. Vito's question - I need Redux to use React ?

No! Redux is not React, and maybe Redux is not Redux ;) Mr [Pony Foo](https://ponyfoo.com/) recently send some frightful article like :

- [Why I no Longer use Redux with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUlwhe-kmog&utm_source=ponyfoo+weekly&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=137)
- [The Suspense is Killing Redux](https://medium.com/@ryanflorence/the-suspense-is-killing-redux-e888f9692430)

I don't know if this is a conspiracy or fake news. Btw my friend Michele(@doppiam) said :

> Massimo fuck u and React! Start using [unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated).

Vito(@m-otiv) viri soccu poi fare, rape na issue (open an issue) for the next arguments.

As a caveat - this is a living doc, and will evolve as priorities grow and shift. The *vito-learn-react project* will always be adapting to new vito studies.
